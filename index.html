   <div class="my_purpose">
   	<h2 align="center">I want to be a programmer</h2>
   	<p>
   		It is not easy to choose your future profession. While you are a school student you can see how a sales assistant or a driver works, but you have only a vague notion about what is going on in offices.
        I was unsure about my future profession until we started learning Scratch at school. It is a simple programming language, which allows to create interactive animations and games. It was so exiting! We completed several easy tasks at school, then I started my own project am home and it became my hobby.
        I like mathematics and computer science, and my marks are good, so I guess that a programmer is a suitable profession for me.
        Of course I understand that this job is very demanding. Computer technology moves fast, so I will have to learn new things all the time. But it is probably not so bad.
        I’ve made a little research of vacancies. Software developers fortunately are in demand and salaries are good. This is also important for me.
        But vacancies of trade companies seemed a bit boring to me. I dream of working in game industry. I like computer games myself. A computer game is an immersion to another reality, excitement and pleasure. That is why I think this job would be satisfying.
        So I will do my best to enter the university and make my dream come true.
